# SpiderWarp 🕷️🌀

**SpiderWarp** is the first automated quantum circuit optimizer designed specifically for **Fault-Tolerant Quantum Gadgets**. 

Unlike standard tools that only preserve logical unitaries, SpiderWarp uses **Distance-Preserving Rewrites** to optimize CSS-code based Clifford circuits.
It "warps" the circuit topology—reducing CNOT and ancilla counts via the OCM (Only Connectivity Matters) rule—while strictly ensuring that the gadget's error-correcting properties and fault-distance remain intact.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Topological Morphing:** Automatically "bends" wires and fuses spiders to eliminate redundant hardware overhead.
* **Zero-Metadata Inference:** No manual tagging required. SpiderWarp automatically identifies:
    * **Qubit Roles:** Distinguishes between persistent Data qubits and lifecycle-limited Ancillas.
    * **Measurement Types:** Categorizes outcomes into Syndromes (stabilizers) or Flags (high-weight fault catchers) by analyzing the parity-check graph.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Seamlessly ingest and optimize gadgets from **OpenQASM 3.0** and **Stim**.
* **Strict FT-Preservation:** Every rewrite is verified against the gadget’s fault-signature, ensuring that a weight-1 fault never "warps" into an uncorrectable logical error.

## 🛠 How it Works

SpiderWarp treats FT gadgets as dynamic spacetime volumes rather than static gate lists.

### 1. Unified Qubit & Measurement Logic
The library eliminates the "Labeling Burden." It parses your circuit and derives roles from the **Detector Error Model (DEM)**:
* **Ancillas** are identified by their local initialization-to-measurement footprint.
* **Syndromes** are identified as measurements participating in temporal parity checks (Detectors).
* **Flags** are identified as local parity checks designed to catch circuit-level "hooks."

### 2. The OCM Warp Rule
By mapping the gadget to a ZX-diagram, SpiderWarp applies the **Outer Commutation Markup (OCM)** rule. This allows for the "bending" of wires—effectively commuting gates through the stabilizer boundary—to cancel out CNOTs that are logically redundant but physically expensive.

## 💻 Usage

```python
import spiderwarp as sw

# Load a Stim or OpenQASM 3.0 circuit
gadget = sw.load_circuit("syndrome_extraction.qasm")

# SpiderWarp automatically infers roles
print(gadget.ancillas)   # [4, 5, 6]
print(gadget.syndromes)  # [M0, M1]

# Perform Fault-Invariant Optimization
optimized_gadget = sw.warp(gadget)

# Export back to Stim for verification
optimized_gadget.to_stim("optimized.stim")
